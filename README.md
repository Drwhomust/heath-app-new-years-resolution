Small app for me and my new year resolution

This is a very personal app i made because i am very fat and chunky

So to help me lose weight I want to exercise more! So I am setting my self a goal of walking around 20 minutes on a treadmill every day for the year

But only one thing...

I can't keep track because my ADHD brain says "nuh uh"

So I made this to keep track of my progress!

feel free to do whatever you want with the source code idc. This is just a personal app for me
